I am currently a candidate of Master of Science in Business Analytics program at **Simon Business School, University of Rochester**, and right now in pursuit of a career as a data-driven decision maker. You can check my [Data Analytical Project](https://neilshen9747.github.io/DataAnalyticalProject/) and [Business Case Study](https://neilshen9747.github.io/BusinessCaseStudy/), where I show all my data-related project work and case studies.

Besides, I have been playing volleyball for almost four years, and I was the Opposite Spiker of my university man's volleyball team.
